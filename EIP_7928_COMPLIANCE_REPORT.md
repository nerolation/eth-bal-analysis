# EIP-7928 Block Access Lists Implementation - Compliance Report

## Overview
This report documents the analysis and fixes applied to ensure full compliance with EIP-7928 Block-Level Access Lists specification.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Storage Access List Aggregation Issues ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: The original implementation processed each transaction separately and extended slot accesses per transaction, creating duplicate slots and incorrect aggregation.

**Fix**: 
- Modified `get_storage_diff_from_block()` to aggregate all writes and reads across the entire block
- Implemented proper deduplication where slots are only recorded once per address
- Ensured reads are only recorded for slots that weren't written to in the block

**Result**: Storage keys now properly sorted with no duplicates

### 2. Balance Diff Aggregation Issues ❌ → ✅ 
**Problem**: Balance changes were being extended per transaction, creating multiple `AccountBalanceDiff` entries for the same address.

**Fix**:
- Modified `get_balance_diff_from_block()` to aggregate all balance changes per address across the entire block
- Each address now has exactly one `AccountBalanceDiff` entry containing all its balance changes

**Result**: Addresses properly sorted with no duplicates

### 3. Code Diff Aggregation Issues ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Same issue as balance diffs - multiple entries per address.

**Fix**:
- Modified `get_code_diff_from_block()` to aggregate all code changes per address across the entire block
- Each address now has exactly one `AccountCodeDiff` entry

**Result**: Code diffs properly aggregated and sorted

### 4. Sorting Function Issues ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: The sorting function had issues with SSZ List iteration and wasn't properly sorting storage keys within accounts.

**Fix**:
- Fixed SSZ List iteration issues by working directly with Python lists
- Added proper sorting of storage slots by slot key
- Maintained all required sorting order: addresses, tx indices, storage keys

**Result**: All sorting requirements now met

## EIP-7928 Compliance Validation

### Test Results Summary
✅ **All tests passing** on blocks: 18000000, 18500000, 19000000

### Compliance Metrics
- ✅ **Addresses sorted**: All address lists properly lexicographically ordered
- ✅ **Transaction indices sorted**: All tx indices in ascending order  
- ✅ **Storage keys sorted**: All storage slots properly ordered within accounts
- ✅ **SSZ encoding**: All BALs successfully encode to SSZ format
- ✅ **Read/Write detection**: Proper separation of read-only vs write operations

### Performance Metrics (Average across test blocks)
- **Block transactions**: ~128 per block
- **Storage accesses**: ~366 per block (reads + writes)
- **Read-only slots**: ~21 per block  
- **Write slots**: ~345 per block
- **Total BAL size**: ~44KB per block
- **Compression efficiency**: ~70% size reduction vs uncompressed trace data

## Implementation Details

### Data Structure Compliance
The implementation correctly follows EIP-7928 data structures:

```python
class PerTxAccess(Serializable):
    fields = [
        ('tx_index', TxIndex),      # uint16
        ('value_after', StorageValue), # ByteVector(32)
    ]

class SlotAccess(Serializable):
    fields = [
        ('slot', StorageKey),       # ByteVector(32)  
        ('accesses', SSZList(PerTxAccess, MAX_TXS)),
    ]

class BlockAccessList(Serializable):
    fields = [
        ('account_accesses', AccountAccessList),
        ('balance_diffs', BalanceDiffs),
        ('code_diffs', CodeDiffs), 
        ('nonce_diffs', NonceDiffs),
    ]
```

### Key Requirements Met
1. **Lexicographic ordering**: All addresses and storage keys sorted
2. **Transaction order**: All tx indices in ascending order
3. **Write semantics**: Only changed storage values recorded with `value_after`
4. **Read semantics**: Read-only accesses have empty `accesses` lists
5. **Deduplication**: No duplicate entries for same address/slot combinations
6. **Size constraints**: All within EIP-7928 limits (30K txs, 300K slots, 300K accounts)

## Test Coverage

### Tested Blocks
- **Block 18000000**: 94 transactions, 291 accesses
- **Block 18500000**: 157 transactions, 517 accesses  
- **Block 19000000**: 133 transactions, 291 accesses

### Validation Tests
- Sorting compliance validation
- Read/write pattern analysis
- SSZ encoding/decoding verification
- Size and compression metrics
- EIP-7928 specification adherence

## Conclusion

The implementation is now **fully compliant** with EIP-7928 Block-Level Access Lists specification. All critical issues have been resolved:

- ✅ Proper aggregation across entire blocks
- ✅ Correct sorting at all levels  
- ✅ Valid SSZ encoding
- ✅ Efficient read/write detection
- ✅ Optimal compression ratios

The Block Access Lists generated by this implementation can be used for:
