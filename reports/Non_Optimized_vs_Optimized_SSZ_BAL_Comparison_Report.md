# Non-Optimized vs Optimized SSZ Block Access List (BAL) Encoding Comparison Report

**Generated:** December 2024  
**Ethereum Blocks Analyzed:** 11 blocks (overlapping dataset)  
**Analysis Type:** SSZ implementations with storage reads included  

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive comparison of non-optimized SSZ and optimized SSZ (with address + slot mapping) encoding formats for Ethereum Block Access Lists (BALs) as proposed in EIP-7928. Both implementations include storage reads for complete EIP-7928 compliance. The analysis reveals that **the address + slot mapping optimization adds significant overhead** rather than providing space savings, with the optimized version being approximately **61.0% larger** than the non-optimized version.

## Methodology

### Test Environment
- **Non-Optimized Builder**: `src/bal_builder.py` (standard SSZ implementation)
- **Optimized Builder**: `src/bal_builder_optimized_address_slot_mapping.py` (address + slot mapping)
- **Block Range**: Recent Ethereum mainnet blocks with storage reads included
- **Configuration**: Both builders run with storage reads enabled
- **Compression**: Snappy compression applied to all measurements

### Data Generation Process
1. **Block Processing**: Both builders processed identical sets of 11 overlapping blocks
2. **Component Extraction**: Separate analysis of storage access, balance diffs, code diffs, and nonce diffs
3. **Mapping Analysis**: Additional analysis of address and slot mapping overhead
4. **Encoding**: Standard SSZ vs optimized SSZ with index-based addressing

## Detailed Analysis

### Storage Access (Primary Component)
The optimized version achieves dramatic storage access reduction of 56.0% (40.66 ‚Üí 17.90 KiB), but this significant improvement is still overshadowed by the mapping overhead:
- **Storage Savings**: 22.76 KiB per block
- **Mapping Cost**: 36.28 KiB per block  
- **Net Impact**: -13.52 KiB per block

### Balance Diffs (Secondary Component)
The optimization achieves 25.9% reduction in balance diff sizes:
- **Non-Optimized**: 5.26 ¬± 2.28 KiB
- **Optimized**: 3.89 ¬± 1.06 KiB
- **Savings**: 1.36 KiB per block

### Code & Nonce Diffs (Minor Components)
Significant percentage improvements in smaller components:
- **Code Diffs**: 89.4% reduction (1.41 ‚Üí 0.15 KiB)
- **Nonce Diffs**: 20.7% reduction (0.058 ‚Üí 0.046 KiB)
- **Combined Savings**: 1.27 KiB per block

### Mapping Overhead Analysis
The optimization's fundamental challenge is the high mapping overhead:

#### Address Mapping Efficiency
- **Unique addresses per block**: 302.0 average
- **Address mapping overhead**: 4.09 KiB
- **Efficiency**: 13.9 bytes per unique address
- **Assessment**: Reasonable efficiency for high-duplication scenarios

#### Slot Mapping Efficiency  
- **Unique slots per block**: 1,112.5 average
- **Slot mapping overhead**: 32.20 KiB
- **Efficiency**: 29.6 bytes per unique slot
- **Assessment**: High overhead due to low duplication ratio

## Block-by-Block Consistency

The optimization shows poor consistency across blocks:
- **Blocks where optimization helps**: 3/11 (27.3%)
- **Blocks where non-optimized is better**: 8/11 (72.7%)
- **Largest optimization benefit**: 47.52 KiB
- **Largest optimization penalty**: 54.97 KiB
- **Average penalty**: 10.88 KiB

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why the Optimization Fails
1. **Low Duplication Ratios**: 
   - Address duplication: ~5.1x (good but not enough to offset overhead)
   - Slot duplication: ~2.2x (marginal benefit with high overhead cost)

2. **High Mapping Overhead**:
   - Each unique address: 20 bytes in mapping table
   - Each unique slot: 32 bytes in mapping table
   - Break-even requires much higher duplication ratios

3. **Moderate Dataset Size**:
   - Individual components are moderately sized (47.38 KiB total)
   - Fixed mapping overhead still dominates despite significant storage savings

### Theoretical Break-Even Analysis
For the optimization to be beneficial:
- **Address mapping**: Needs >1.11x duplication (achieved: 5.1x ‚úÖ)
- **Slot mapping**: Needs >1.07x duplication (achieved: 2.2x ‚úÖ)
- **Combined**: Overhead exceeds individual component savings ‚ùå

## Recommendations

### ‚ùå Current Optimization Not Recommended
The current address + slot mapping optimization is **not recommended** for production use because:
- Adds 61.0% size overhead on average
- Benefits only 27.3% of blocks  
- Mapping overhead (62.3%) dominates actual data (37.7%)
- Despite achieving 56% storage access reduction, net result is still negative

### üîÑ Alternative Approaches

#### 1. Address-Only Mapping
- Remove slot mapping (saves ~32 KiB overhead)
- Keep address mapping (efficient 5.1x duplication)
- Estimated improvement: Reduce overhead to ~4 KiB

#### 2. Conditional Optimization
- Apply mapping only when duplication ratio exceeds threshold
- Pre-analyze blocks to determine optimization benefit
- Use non-optimized format for low-duplication blocks

#### 3. Alternative Compression Strategies
- Variable-length encoding for common addresses/slots
- Dictionary compression for repeated patterns
- Huffman coding for frequent access patterns

#### 4. Hybrid Approach
- Combine multiple optimization techniques
- Apply different strategies based on block characteristics
- Optimize for specific use cases (archival vs real-time)

### ‚úÖ Immediate Actions
1. **Disable current optimization** for production workloads
2. **Use non-optimized SSZ** as the baseline implementation
3. **Research alternative compression** strategies before implementing optimizations
4. **Validate benefits** with larger datasets before deployment

## Technical Lessons Learned

### Optimization Principles
1. **Measure twice, optimize once**: Always validate benefits with real data
2. **Consider total cost**: Include all overhead in optimization analysis  
3. **Test edge cases**: Ensure optimization benefits across various scenarios
4. **Start simple**: Avoid complex optimizations without proven need

### Implementation Insights
1. **Mapping overhead scales with uniqueness**: More unique items = higher overhead
2. **Fixed costs dominate small datasets**: Optimizations need sufficient data volume
3. **Duplication analysis is critical**: Theoretical vs actual duplication can differ significantly

## Conclusion

The address + slot mapping optimization for SSZ BAL encoding, while technically sound in implementation, produces a net negative result due to excessive mapping overhead. The 36.28 KiB mapping cost exceeds the 25.02 KiB total component savings, resulting in a 61.0% size increase.

**Key Takeaway**: While the optimization successfully achieves significant component-level compression (56% storage access reduction), the fixed mapping overhead dominates the benefits. Compression optimizations must be carefully validated against real-world data characteristics and total system overhead.

**Next Steps**: Focus on alternative optimization strategies that provide better overhead-to-benefit ratios, or accept the non-optimized SSZ format as the most practical solution for BAL encoding given current Ethereum block characteristics.
