| 22886604 | 34.8 KB | 32.4 KB | SSZ +2.4 KB (+7.5%) |

## Methodology

### Test Environment
- **Builders Used**: Current implementations
  - `src/bal_builder_rlp.py` (RLP implementation)
  - `src/bal_builder.py` (SSZ implementation)
- **Block Range**: Recent Ethereum mainnet blocks (every 10th block)
- **Configurations**: Both with and without storage reads
- **Compression**: Snappy compression applied to all measurements

## Conclusions

1. **RLP is consistently more space-efficient**: Across all tested blocks, RLP encoding produces smaller compressed BALs
2. **SSZ overhead is moderate**: SSZ files are 7.1% larger without reads
, 5.0% larger with reads
3. **Both formats compress well**: Achieving ~60% compression ratios with Snappy
4. **Storage reads significantly impact size**: Adding reads increases BAL size by ~40-45% for both formats
5. **Consistency is high**: RLP is smaller in 100% of tested blocks

## Recommendations

1. **For pure space efficiency**: RLP encoding offers the best compression
2. **For consensus and merkleization**: SSZ provides better structure and type safety despite the ~7% size overhead
3. **For gas calculation only**: Use the --no-reads variant to reduce size by ~40%
4. **For archival storage**: The consistent ~7% overhead of SSZ may be acceptable given its other benefits
